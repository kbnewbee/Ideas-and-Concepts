complete works of william shakespeare.txt  Now is the time that face should form another,  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,  Of his self-love to stop posterity?    Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.    But if thou live remembered not to be,    Die single and thine image dies with thee.                     4  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,  And being frank she lends to those are free:  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,  The bounteous largess given thee to give?  Profitless usurer why dost thou use  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?  For having traffic with thy self alone,  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?      Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,    Which used lives th' executor to be.                     5  Those hours that with gentle work did frame  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell  Will play the tyrants to the very same,  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:  For never-resting time leads summer on  To hideous winter and confounds him there,  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:  Then were not summer's distillation left  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.                     6    Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:  That use is not forbidden usury,  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;  That's for thy self to breed another thee,  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,  Leaving thee living in posterity?    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.                     7  Lo in the orient when the gracious light  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,    And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,Page 5
complete works of william shakespeare.txt  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are  From his low tract and look another way:    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.                     8  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,  By unions married do offend thine ear,  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:    Mark how one string sweet husband to another,  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,    Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.                     9  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,  The world will be thy widow and still weep,  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,  When every private widow well may keep,  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,  And kept unused the user so destroys it:      No love toward others in that bosom sits    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.                     10  For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any  Who for thy self art so unprovident.  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:  For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,    Make thee another self for love of me,    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.                     11    As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,  If all were minded so, the times should cease,  And threescore year would make the world away:  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,Page 6
complete works of william shakespeare.txt  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.                     12  When I do count the clock that tells the time,  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,  When I behold the violet past prime,  And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:    When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:  Then of thy beauty do I question make  That thou among the wastes of time must go,  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,  And die as fast as they see others grow,    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.                     13  O that you were your self, but love you are  No longer yours, than you your self here live,  Against this coming end you should prepare,  And your sweet semblance to some other give.  So should that beauty which you hold in lease  Find no determination, then you were  Your self again after your self's decease,  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.    Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,    You had a father, let your son say so.                     14  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,  And yet methinks I have astronomy,  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,  Or say with princes if it shall go well  By oft predict that I in heaven find.  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,  And constant stars in them I read such art  As truth and beauty shall together thrive  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:      Or else of thee this I prognosticate,    Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.                     15  When I consider every thing that grows  Holds in perfection but a little moment.  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.  When I perceive that men as plants increase,  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,  And wear their brave state out of memory.  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,  Where wasteful time debateth with decay  To change your day of youth to sullied night,    And all in war with Time for love of you,Page 7

And fortify your self in your decay  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,  And many maiden gardens yet unset,  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:  So should the lines of life that life repair  Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.    To give away your self, keeps your self still,    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.                     17  Who will believe my verse in time to come  If it were filled with your most high deserts?  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:    If I could write the beauty of your eyes,  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,  The age to come would say this poet lies,  Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,  And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,  And stretched metre of an antique song.    But were some child of yours alive that time,    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.                     18  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,  And every fair from fair sometime declines,  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,  Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.                     19  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,  And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,  O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,  Him in thy course untainted do allow,  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.      Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,    My love shall in my verse ever live young.                     20Page 8
complete works of william shakespeare.txt  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,  A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted  With shifting change as is false women's fashion,  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.  And for a woman wert thou first created,  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,  And by addition me of thee defeated,  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.    But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.                     21    So is it not with me as with that muse,  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,  Making a couplement of proud compare  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:  With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.  O let me true in love but truly write,  And then believe me, my love is as fair,  As any mother's child, though not so bright  As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.                     22  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,  So long as youth and thou are of one date,  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,  Then look I death my days should expiate.    For all that beauty that doth cover thee,  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,  How can I then be elder than thou art?  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,  As I not for my self, but for thee will,  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.                     23  As an unperfect actor on the stage,  Who with his fear is put beside his part,  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:    O let my looks be then the eloquence,  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.                     24  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,  And perspective it is best painter's art.Page 9
complete works of william shakespeare.txt  ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,    Or being, concern you not.  CAESAR. I must be laugh'd at    If, or for nothing or a little,    Should say myself offended, and with you    Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should    Once name you derogately when to sound your name    It not concern'd me.  ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,    What was't to you?  CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome    Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there      Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt    Might be my question.  ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?  CAESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent    By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother    Made wars upon me, and their contestation    Was theme for you; you were the word of war.  ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never    Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,    And have my learning from some true reports    That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather    Discredit my authority with yours,    And make the wars alike against my stomach,    Having alike your cause? Of this my letters    Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,    As matter whole you have not to make it with,    It must not be with this.  CAESAR. You praise yourself    By laying defects of judgment to me; but    You patch'd up your excuses.    ANTONY. Not so, not so;    I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,    Very necessity of this thought, that I,    Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,    Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars    Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,    I would you had her spirit in such another!    The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.  ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to    wars with the women!  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,    Made out of her impatience- which not wanted    Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant    Did you too much disquiet. For that you must    But say I could not help it.  CAESAR. I wrote to you    When rioting in Alexandria; you    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts    Did gibe my missive out of audience.    ANTONY. Sir,    He fell upon me ere admitted. Then    Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want    Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day    I told him of myself, which was as much    As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow    Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,    Out of our question wipe him.  CAESAR. You have broken    The article of your oath, which you shall never    Have tongue to charge me with.  LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!  ANTONY. No;    Lepidus, let him speak.    The honour is sacred which he talks on now,    Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:    The article of my oath-  CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,    The which you both denied.  ANTONY. Neglected, rather;  Page 98
complete works of william shakespeare.txt    And then when poisoned hours had bound me up    From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,    I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power    Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,    To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;    For which myself, the ignorant motive, do    So far ask pardon as befits mine honour    To stoop in such a case.  LEPIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.  MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further    The griefs between ye- to forget them quite    Were to remember that the present need    Speaks to atone you.  LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.  ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,    you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.    You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to    do.  ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.    ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.  ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.  ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!  CAESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but    The manner of his speech; for't cannot be    We shall remain in friendship, our conditions    So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge    O' th' world, I would pursue it.  AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.  CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.  AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,    Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony    Is now a widower.  CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.    If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof    Were well deserv'd of rashness.  ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear    Agrippa further speak.  AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,      To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts    With an unslipping knot, take Antony    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims    No worse a husband than the best of men;    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak    That which none else can utter. By this marriage    All little jealousies, which now seem great,    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,    Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,    Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both    Would each to other, and all loves to both,    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,    By duty ruminated.  ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?  CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd    With what is spoke already.  ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,    If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'    To make this good?    CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and    His power unto Octavia.  ANTONY. May I never    To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,    Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.    Further this act of grace; and from this hour    The heart of brothers govern in our loves    And sway our great designs!  CAESAR. There is my hand.    A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother    Did ever love so dearly. Let her live    To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and neverPage 99
complete works of william shakespeare.txt    Fly off our loves again!  LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!  ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;    For he hath laid strange courtesies and great    Of late upon me. I must thank him only,    Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;    At heel of that, defy him.  LEPIDUS. Time calls upon's.      Of us must Pompey presently be sought,    Or else he seeks out us.  ANTONY. Where lies he?  CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum.  ANTONY. What is his strength by land?  CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea    He is an absolute master.  ANTONY. So is the fame.    Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.    Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we    The business we have talk'd of.  CAESAR. With most gladness;    And do invite you to my sister's view,    Whither straight I'll lead you.  ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,    Not lack your company.  LEPIDUS. Noble Antony,    Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]                     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS  MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.    ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable    friend, Agrippa!  AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!  MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well    digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.  ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made    the night light with drinking.  MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but    twelve persons there. Is this true?  ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more    monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.  MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.  ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,    upon the river of Cydnus.  AGRIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for    her.  ENOBARBUS. I will tell you.    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,    Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that      The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made    The water which they beat to follow faster,    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,    It beggar'd all description. She did lie    In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,    O'erpicturing that Venus where we see    The fancy out-work nature. On each side her    Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,    With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,    And what they undid did.  AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!  ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,    So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,    And made their bends adornings. At the helm    A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands    That yarely frame the office. From the barge    A strange invisible perfume hits the sense      Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast    Her people out upon her; and Antony,    Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,    Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,Page 100
complete works of william shakespeare.txt    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,    And made a gap in nature.  AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!  ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,    Invited her to supper. She replied    It should be better he became her guest;    Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,    Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,    Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,    And for his ordinary pays his heart    For what his eyes eat only.  AGRIPPA. Royal wench!    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.    He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.  ENOBARBUS. I saw her once    Hop forty paces through the public street;      And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,    That she did make defect perfection,    And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.  MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.  ENOBARBUS. Never! He will not.    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale    Her infinite variety. Other women cloy    The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry    Where most she satisfies; for vilest things    Become themselves in her, that the holy priests    Bless her when she is riggish.  MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle    The heart of Antony, Octavia is    A blessed lottery to him.  AGRIPPA. Let us go.    Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest    Whilst you abide here.  ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I than
